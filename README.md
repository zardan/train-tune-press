# On track (P친 sp친ret) 游뚝

This project was initially created using [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) as a proof of concept how far we could prompt our way to a full-stack webb application. I did not succeed to prompt a proper server setup (did come coding myself), but [my collegue did](https://train-tune-press-42.lovable.app/). 

Background: We have an internal "On Track" (Swedish: [P친 Sp친ret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A5_sp%C3%A5ret)) competition and this webpage was developed for the finale, where all participants can pull the emergency break and play the characteristic horn signal.
